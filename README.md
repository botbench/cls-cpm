# CLS for CP/M
There is no built-in utility to clear the screen, so as a first project, I created `CLS` for CP/M.

### Note
This has only been tested on an SC126 Z180 based retro computer, running CP/M 3. 

Made to be built with Z88DK. Change the options in the Makefile to reflect the machine you're compiling for.
